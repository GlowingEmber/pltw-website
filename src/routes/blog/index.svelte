					<h4>Welcome back to the blog y'all</h4>
					<p style="padding-bottom: 10px; color: gray;">Blog post after the Ethics in Engineering project and debate</p>
					<h4>Blog #2</h4>
					<p style="padding-bottom: 10px; color: gray;">I learned that there's always a way to defend the indefensible. In the movie Monsters, Inc., the CEO clearly was 'evil' and was portrayed as the villain. Obviously he's a villain, he's kidnapping children! Regardless, I was able to successfully make a strong case to defend the CEO's actions by citing the economy, jobs, the efficiency of the energy, and the work satisfaction of employees, reminiscent of many PR stunts by top CEOs. This shows how in real life, even the most immoral and terrible people can get away with corruption and criminal activity by having a great PR and/or legal team. Money buys freedom and popularity!</p>
					<p style="padding-bottom: 10px; color: gray;">On an unrelated note, I've been working on college apps and attempting to keep up with schoolwork. I've been working on a physics website for fun recently, too — I might add it here once it's published.</p>

					<h4>Hello Everyone</h4>
					<p style="padding-bottom: 10px; color: gray;">First blog post after creating the website in SvelteJS!</p>
					<h4>Blog #1</h4>
					<p style="padding-bottom: 10px; color: gray;">This summer was a great change from the summer before. I hung out with my friends a lot and took many pictures for my photography class at SMC! I also did a decent amount of coding for my C Programming class, personal projects, and software development for a company called SmileStart.</p>
					<p style="padding-bottom: 10px; color: gray;">I'm mostly excited to work towards a project as a solution to a real-world problem. Class often feels like learning/doing something for the sake of learning/doing something, and because solving problems is a fundamental aspect of engineering, it's what I'm looking forward to.</p>
					<p style="padding-bottom: 10px; color: gray;">In general I'm excited to be able to see all my teachers and friends this year in-person because I feel like that's where authentic connections happen. I'm also looking forward to applying to college to see where I'll end up!</p>
