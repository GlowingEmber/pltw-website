					<h4>Hello Everyone</h4>
					<p style="padding-bottom: 10px; color: gray;">First blog post after creating the website in SvelteJS!</p>
					<h4>Blog #1</h4>
					<p style="padding-bottom: 10px; color: gray;">This summer was a great change from the summer before. I hung out with my friends a lot and took many pictures for my photography class at SMC! I also did a decent amount of coding for my C Programming class, personal projects, and software development for a company called SmileStart.</p>
					<p style="padding-bottom: 10px; color: gray;">I'm mostly excited to work towards a project as a solution to a real-world problem. Class often feels like learning/doing something for the sake of learning/doing something, and because solving problems is a fundamental aspect of engineering, it's what I'm looking forward to.</p>
					<p style="padding-bottom: 10px; color: gray;">In general I'm excited to be able to see all my teachers and friends this year in-person because I feel like that's where authentic connections happen. I'm also looking forward to applying to college to see where I'll end up!</p>
